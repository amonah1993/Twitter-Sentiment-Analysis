# Twitter Sentiment Analysis Project 

This project aimed to identify the sentiments of tweets about face masks from two different periods during the COVID-19 pandemic and to
compare the sentiments from these periods using a state-of-the-art sentiment analysis algorithm called BERT.

The project involved several steps which were data collection, data preprocessing, and
implementation of BERT as a sentiment analysis algorithm.

The evaluation of the implemented BERT algorithm yielded both an f1_score and an accuracy of 89%.

The diagrams showed that positive sentiments were predominant in both periods. The percentage of positive
tweets in the first and second periods was 44.76% and 44.57%, respectively;
however, tweets exhibiting negative and neutral sentiments were also found. The
level (intensity) of the majority of sentiments was high, with high positive
sentiments being predominant. Hence, there was no notable change in sentiments
regarding face masks during the COVID-19 pandemic between the two periods,
as the sentiment percentages were fairly constant, with only slight differences.
